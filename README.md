A donation bank account is a bank account that holds donations for a specific purpose, such as for a small cause, individual, or group of people. The money is set aside for the beneficiary, but the account may not be opened by the beneficiary. 
Here are some types of donation bank accounts: 
Fundraising bank account
A bank account set up to hold donations for a specific purpose 
Donor-advised fund
A charitable account that helps donors organize their giving. Donors can recommend grants to charities, and the fund can grow over time. 
Charitable Donation Account (CDA)
A customizable solution that allows credit unions to donate to those in need. 
Crowded Business Deposit Account
A bank account for fundraisers that has no fees associated with opening, but may have transaction fees. 
Donating by bank account or ACH is generally the least expensive payment method for nonprofits. This means that the nonprofit receives more of the donation.
